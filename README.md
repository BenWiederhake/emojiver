Who needs semantic versioning when you can have [EMOJI VERSIONING](https://benwiederhake.github.io/emojiver/)!

This is a silly project to offer yet another esoteric alternative to semantic versioning. (See also [zerover](https://0ver.org/) and [calver](https://calver.org/) and [Kelvin versioning](https://jtobin.io/kelvin-versioning).)

For more info, see the [official website](https://benwiederhake.github.io/emojiver/).
